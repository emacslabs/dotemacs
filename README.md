## Who we are & what we do?

We love emacs and we develop functions in emacs lisp, 
as a way of research and development in emacs culture.

Emacs is not only an editor. Emacs is textual desktop
environment. It's all you want. Just learn emacs lisp.

From time to time, we post emacs functions for this purpose;
The nomenclature (structure name) of every file (function) should be:

	name_function_function.el

Hope that helps.
 
The buffer force is with you.

emacs|labs team,
